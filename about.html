    <p>  I am Nina Lang and I am pursuing a degree in Management Information Systems (MIS). My foundation is rooted in both sports and technology, giving me a unique and rounded skill set. My experience as an international student athlete has helped me develop strong organizational and time-management skills as I balance intense training and academic commitments. Working with teammates from diverse backgrounds has enabled me to foster a collaborative spirit among team members. My journey has been marked by living and studying in different countries, and competing with athletes from all over the world. Not only has this experience broadened my worldview, but it has also empowered me to navigate diverse environments with adaptability and resilience. My fluency in both English and German (my first language) enables me to communicate effectively, fostering effective collaboration and understanding. My knowledge of Excel, Word, and other relevant tools, along with a broader understanding of information technology, go beyond language proficiency. </p>
